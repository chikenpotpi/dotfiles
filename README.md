# My dotfiles for various themes and color schemes

### klassy-dark-gtk
klassy-dark-gtk is meant to be used with Adwaita and Adwaita GTK-3 and the "Klassy Dark" Color Scheme.

This was generated from cosmic-settings but I added/removed a couple things:
* Removed the rim on GTK-3 windows.
* Removed the line bewtween headerbar and background for GTK-3/4. (There is still a faint line but I coudn't figure out a way to remove it.)
* Uses color set in KDE settings
